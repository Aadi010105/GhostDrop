## üìã Problem Statement

In today's digital landscape, file sharing solutions face critical challenges:

- **Privacy Concerns**: Most platforms store files indefinitely with questionable data handling practices
- **Security Gaps**: Files are often stored in plaintext, vulnerable to breaches and unauthorized access
- **Collaboration Limitations**: Existing solutions lack real-time collaborative features for temporary sharing
- **User Friction**: Complex authentication requirements prevent quick, anonymous sharing
- **Data Persistence**: No reliable way to ensure files are automatically deleted after intended use

GhostDrop addresses these issues by providing a **privacy-first, ephemeral file sharing platform** that combines the simplicity of WeTransfer, the security of ProtonDrive, and the collaboration features of Dropbox.

## üéØ What is GhostDrop?

GhostDrop is a cloud-based, privacy-first file sharing & storage platform that enables users to:

### Core Features
- üì§ **Upload & Share Files Temporarily** - Auto-delete after 1h/1d/1w or custom TTL
- üîê **Multiple Access Methods** - OTP, email invite, or QR code links
- üë• **Real-time Collaboration** - Shared folders with live updates, comments, and activity streams
- üõ°Ô∏è **Client-side Encryption** - WebCrypto API + AES-GCM for maximum security
- üîó **Account-optional Sharing** - Recipients don't need accounts, uploaders can use accounts for advanced features

### Contextual Collaboration
GhostDrop provides a rich suite of features designed for seamless team collaboration:
- üí¨ **Live Chat & Threaded Comments per File**: Engage in real-time discussions directly on files, with threaded comments for organized conversations and @mentions to tag team members. Built with Socket.IO for instant updates.
- ü§ù **Shared Team Workspaces**: Organize teams into dedicated workspaces (e.g., departments, projects). Each workspace supports shared folders, centralized settings, granular permissions, and a unified activity feed for all team members.
- üëÅÔ∏è **Collaborative File Previews & Annotations**: View rich, interactive previews for various file types (PDFs, code, video, images). Add inline comments and annotations directly on the preview, facilitating precise feedback and collaborative review. Leveraging libraries like `PDF.js`, `react-dropzone`, and `monaco-editor` for robust preview capabilities.

### Key Differentiators
- **Ephemeral by Design**: Guaranteed automatic deletion with TTL enforcement
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Client-side encryption ensures server never sees plaintext
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live updates for shared folders, files, comments, and activities, powered by Socket.IO
- **Privacy-First**: No data mining, no tracking, no permanent storage

    - [ ] CloudFront distribution + Origin Access Control (OAC) for private S3 access  
  - [ ] Server skeleton (Express)  
    - [ ] Project structure, env config, logging, request validation (Zod/Joi)  
    - [ ] Health-check and readiness endpoints  
    - [ ] CORS, security headers (helmet), rate limiter middleware  
  - [ ] Neon (Postgres) + Prisma  
    - [ ] Design DB schema: users, files, shares, folders, activities, keys  
    - [ ] Add `expiry` timestamp field on files and shares (for TTL logic)  
    - [ ] Prisma migrations & seeding scripts

- **Week 3‚Äì4: Authentication & File Management**
  - [ ] Integrate Clerk Node SDK for authentication and user management (optionally add webhooks for syncing users with Prisma)
  - [ ] JWT validation middleware & RBAC (owner/editor/viewer)  
  - [ ] File upload flow (API + S3)  
    - [ ] `POST /api/files/presign` ‚Üí generate S3 presigned (single or multipart)  
    - [ ] `POST /api/files/complete` ‚Üí finalize multipart + store metadata in Postgres  
    - [ ] Support `multipart` part presigns for large files  
    - [ ] Store `s3Key`, `size`, `mimeType`, `expiry`, `encryptedKeyMetadata` in DB  
  - [ ] Upload progress tracking support (client ‚Üî server progress events)  
  - [ ] **Backend Route Testing (manual)**  
    - [ ] Use **Postman** to test and save requests for:
      - [ ] Auth routes (`/auth/*`) ‚Äî signup/login, token validation  
      - [ ] File routes (`/files/presign`, `/files/complete`, `/files/:id/download`)  
      - [ ] Folder & sharing routes (`/folders`, `/shares`)  
    - **Acceptance:** Postman collection can successfully run manual requests and returns expected status codes and JSON.

---

### üü° Phase 2: Security & Encryption (Weeks 5‚Äì6)
**Goal:** Make file operations privacy-first and resilient

- [ ] Client-side encryption using **WebCrypto API** (AES-GCM)  
  - [ ] Uploader generates symmetric key, encrypts file before uploading  
  - [ ] Generate and store per-file IVs / metadata for decryption  
- [ ] Key wrapping for sharing:
  - [ ] Wrap AES key with recipient public keys or OTP-derived keys
  - [ ] APIs to store/retrieve wrapped keys (`/keys/wrap`, `/keys/unwrapped`)  
- [ ] Server-side checks:
  - [ ] File type whitelist / MIME validation  
  - [ ] File size caps for anonymous uploads  
  - [ ] Rate-limiting middleware (IP/user)  
- [ ] **Postman**:
  - [ ] Test endpoints that return wrapped key blobs and permission checks.  
- **Acceptance:** Encrypted files can be uploaded and decrypted by recipients only after successful key unwrap.

---

### üü° Phase 3: TTL & Auto-Deletion (Weeks 7‚Äì8)
**Goal:** Reliable ephemeral storage with cleanup pipeline

- [ ] TTL design:
  - [ ] `expiry` timestamp stored in Postgres `files` table
  - [ ] Optionally store a lightweight cache/flag in Redis for quick expiry checks (optional)
- [ ] Scheduled cleanup service:
  - [ ] Simple Node cron worker (or Render cron / GitHub Actions + endpoint) that runs every N minutes:
    - [ ] Query expired files (`expiry < now()`)
    - [ ] Delete corresponding S3 objects
    - [ ] Delete DB records and write deletion activity logs
  - [ ] Implement batch deletion & retry logic
- [ ] Confirmations & audit:
  - [ ] Create deletion activity entry per deleted file
  - [ ] Optional soft-delete retention for short window (configurable)
- [ ] **Postman**:
  - [ ] Test the cleanup endpoint in staging to verify S3 deletions and DB record removal.
- **Acceptance:** Files with `expiry` in past are removed from S3 and DB within the configured cleanup interval, with logs created.

---

### üü° Phase 4: Sharing & Access Control (Weeks 9‚Äì10)
**Goal:** Multiple secure sharing options + robust permission model

- [ ] Implement sharing methods:
  - [ ] OTP-based share (create OTP + wrapped key + short URL)  
  - [ ] Email invites (send secure link with optional OTP)  
  - [ ] QR code generation for mobile share links  
  - [ ] Custom link creation with optional password/OTP and expiry  
- [ ] Permission model:
  - [ ] Folder-level roles (owner, editor, viewer) + file-level overrides  
  - [ ] Download tracking + access logs (user, timestamp, IP)  
  - [ ] Revoke share endpoint (`POST /shares/:id/revoke`)  
- [ ] **Postman**:
  - [ ] Test invite + accept flows, OTP validation, and access revocation.
- **Acceptance:** Shared links only grant access per permission rules; revocation prevents further access.

---

### üü° Phase 5: Real-time Collaboration (Weeks 11‚Äì12)
**Goal:** Live multi-user experience for shared folders, files, comments, and workspaces

- [ ] Socket.IO integration:
  - [ ] WebSocket server setup with namespaces/rooms for folders & files
  - [ ] File-specific chat threads with Socket.IO
  - [ ] Choose a cross-instance pub/sub:
    - [ ] **Neon LISTEN/NOTIFY** for light-volume events, **OR** Redis adapter for higher scale
  - [ ] Connection lifecycle and auth (validate Clerk JWT on socket handshake)
- [ ] Real-time features:
  - [ ] File upload/complete notifications in folder/file room
  - [ ] Real-time threaded comments & @mentions per file
  - [ ] Broadcast activity updates on comments, edits, previews
  - [ ] Presence indicators (who is viewing/editing a file/folder)
- [ ] **Workspace-level collaboration backend:**
  - [ ] Database schema updates for Workspaces (name, owner, members, settings)
  - [ ] APIs for workspace creation, management, member invitation/roles
  - [ ] Workspace-specific activity feed integration
- [ ] **Postman / websocket client**:
  - [ ] Use a websocket client (or Postman‚Äôs websocket support) to test events end-to-end.
- **Acceptance:** Users in same folder/file/workspace receive real-time events reliably across multiple backend instances; workspace management APIs are functional.

---

### ‚ö´ Phase 6: Frontend Development (Weeks 13‚Äì16)
